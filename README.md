# codingTasks
Cybersecurity Bootcamp tasks are mini projects that have helped me to get an undertanding of python. Each task below is a part of my learning and journey into python coding. 

# Award.py 
Award.py calculates if a participant is to be given an award for completing a triathlon.

The program takes the total amount of time taken for a contestant to complete each event of cycling, running and swimming and adds them together. 

If the total time is within pre-defined ranges it will tell the user or contest if they have been awarded. 


## Installation 
You can clone the project directly from this repo to your local system.

### 1. Git clone 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/surjithctly/astroship.git .
```

The `.` will clone it to the current directory so make sure you are inside your project folder.

### 2. Python 
You will need Python to run the program. Download the latest version of Python here:

#### For Mac OS  
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/
```

#### For Windows: 
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows
```

#### For Lunix:
```
https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
```

## Running Award.py

Open you terminal and go to the file where the award.py code has been saved. 

To run award.py enter the following: 

#### For Mac OS

### Criteria 

The program will then add the minutes together and compare the total to the pre-defined criteria below: 

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Total Score | Award |
| --- | ------ | 
| <= 100 | Honorary Colours| 
| 101 <= total <= 105 | Honorary Half Colours |
| 106 <= total <= 110   | Honorary Scroll |
| >110 | No award |
